## ⚡ Why Nexus CV is Different

Unlike simple keyword-matching ATS parsers or fragile, single-prompt LLM wrappers, **Nexus CV** brings a robust, defense-in-depth approach to resume intelligence:

1. **Hybrid Scoring Engine:** Combines heuristic rules (TF-IDF, keyword density, completeness) with a custom-trained **XGBoost machine learning model** to predict candidate viability with high analytical precision.
2. **4-Agent ReAct Pipeline:** Leverages specialized, collaborative LLM agents with native validation loops. The final verdict requires **strict evidence quotes** verified against actual text chunks.
3. **Resilient Multi-Model Fallbacks:** Features an automated, thread-safe, and self-healing LLM chain starting at Google Gemini, falling back to Groq, and landing on localized rules to guarantee 100% service availability.
4. **Self-Hosted Bulk Orchestration:** Combines a high-throughput Flask API with an asynchronous, self-hosted **n8n workflow engine** to extract, parse, clean, score, and rank batches of up to 50 resumes concurrently.

### Architectural Breakdown

#### 1. Frontend Layer
* A highly optimized, responsive web interface built on vanilla CSS and modern JS.
* Styled using **glassmorphic design principles**, supporting real-time theme switching (Dark/Light mode) without layout shifts.
* Utilizes **Chart.js** to render dynamic score charts, keyword density radars, and historical ATS progress curves.

#### 2. Backend Layer
* A secure, robust **Flask** application serving as the primary API controller, session manager, and static page renderer.
* Hardened with comprehensive security mechanisms: **Flask-WTF CSRF validation**, rate limiting via **Flask-Limiter**, and strict response-level security headers (XSS, HSTS, Frame Options).
* Supports standard authentication and secure social logins via **OAuth 2.0 (Google & Microsoft)**.

#### 3. AI Layer
* Houses the collaborative **Multi-Agent Reasoner** that orchestrates specialist agents through a defined workflow.
* Coordinates the multi-model **LLM fallback sequence**, ensuring automatic retry, thread-safe request throttling, and JSON output parsing normalization.

#### 4. ML Layer
* The core analytical powerhouse containing our custom-trained **XGBoost (XGBRegressor) model**, which evaluates candidates based on a 7-dimensional engineered feature space.
* Manages text embeddings via **BGE-large-en-v1.5** (run locally or hosted via lightweight pipelines) to calculate accurate semantic similarities.

#### 5. RAG Layer
* Powered by **FAISS**, this layer splits, chunks, indexes, and retrieves candidate resume sections.
* Utilizes **semantic chunking** which respects document boundaries (e.g. keeps experience bullet points grouped under the corresponding company) rather than blindly splitting by character counts.
* Prioritizes skill-dense and experience-heavy fragments to serve as contextual groundings for agent prompts.

#### 6. Orchestration Layer
* Uses a self-hosted **n8n workflow server** to handle intensive, non-blocking asynchronous operations such as multi-file ZIP uploads.
* Employs **APScheduler** background workers inside the Flask server to monitor file lifecycles and safely clean up uploads/reports directories every 6 hours.

#### 7. Database / Storage Layer
* Uses a structured **SQLite database** mapped through **SQLAlchemy** to store user accounts, analysis histories, and generated metadata.
* Coordinates local disk storage directories safely designated for short-lived PDFs and raw parsing intermediates.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Pipeline

Nexus CV splits complex candidate evaluation into a modular **4-Agent Pipeline** coordinate by an `AgentController` to eliminate bias and produce highly structured verdicts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Controller as Agent Controller
    participant Skill as Skill Agent (Rule)
    participant Exp as Experience Agent (LLM)
    participant ATS as ATS Agent (XGBoost)
    participant Decision as Decision Agent (ReAct)

    User->>Controller: Submit Resume + Job Description
    Note over Controller: Init Pipeline
    
    Controller->>Skill: Pass Resume Chunks & Skill Registry
    Note over Skill: Parse & Normalize Keywords<br/>Compare Cosine Embeddings
    Skill-->>Controller: Return Skill Score (0-50) & Matches
    
    Controller->>Exp: Pass Resume Sections
    Note over Exp: Analyze Career Progress<br/>Evaluate Metric Impact
    Exp-->>Controller: Return Experience Insights & Bullet Highlights
    
    Controller->>ATS: Pass Engineered Features
    Note over ATS: Run XGBoost Predictor<br/>Compute Completeness Score
    ATS-->>Controller: Return ATS Structural Score (0-50)
    
    Controller->>Decision: Synthesize all Agent signals
    Note over Decision: Loop 1: Gather Evidences<br/>Loop 2: Formulate Final Score<br/>Extract Direct Quotes
    Decision-->>Controller: Return Verdict & Confidence Rating
    
    Controller->>User: Display Synthesized Dashboard & PDF Report
```

### The Specialist Agents
1. **SkillAgent (Deterministic / Embedding):** Checks for technical and soft skill match-rates. It uses **BGE-large** embeddings to capture semantic synonyms and applies fuzzy matching to map colloquial phrasing to industry standards. No LLM calls are used, keeping it deterministic and fast.
2. **ExperienceAgent (LLM-Assisted):** Evaluates career trajectory, leadership markers, and qualitative progression. It analyzes whether bullet points focus on responsibilities or tangible achievements using impact metrics (e.g., "reduced latency by 40%").
3. **ATSAgent (Machine Learning):** Extracts 7 structural and statistical features and feeds them into the pre-trained **XGBoost regressor** alongside a standard section-completeness check.
4. **DecisionAgent (ReAct Reasoning):** The pipeline's brain. It takes outputs from the previous three agents, reasons over their findings, extracts **direct verification quotes** from the resume, evaluates its own confidence (High/Medium/Low), and issues a final, mathematically aligned score and qualitative verdict.

### ReAct (Reasoning and Action) Loop
The **DecisionAgent** executes a 2-iteration ReAct loop:
* **Thought 1:** "I have the Skill score (42/50), the Experience rating (Strong), and the ATS structural score (45/50). I need to determine if the candidate's core accomplishments support this high rating."
* **Action 1:** Search FAISS for specific project achievements or experience bullet points.
* **Observation 1:** Found chunk: *"Led a team of 4 engineers to rebuild the analytics pipeline using Flask and XGBoost."*
* **Thought 2:** "The candidate has demonstrated hands-on leadership using our exact tech stack. I will formulate the final verdict, quote this evidence, and assign a High confidence level."
* **Action 2:** Deliver the final unified response structure.

## 🔍 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

To guarantee high accuracy and completely eliminate model hallucination, Nexus CV implements a specialized localized **RAG System**:

```
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │    Section-Aware Chunks (Company, Projects, Skills)      │
 └──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                            │ Embedding (BGE-large)
                            ▼
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

 └──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                            │ User Query / Job Description
                            ▼
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │            Prioritized Prompt Context Injection          │
 │   - Experience-Heavy (80% Weight)                        │
 │   - Skill-Heavy      (20% Weight)                        │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

* **Semantic Chunking:** Resumes are parsed by **pdfplumber** and parsed into logical sections using layout patterns. Instead of character-based limits, splitting occurs at logical boundary limits (e.g., company experience blocks or project cards) to preserve localized context.
* **Section-Aware Retrieval:** Chunks are tagged with metadata identifying their source sections (e.g., `experience`, `skills`, `education`). 
* **FAISS Vector Search:** Embeddings are generated using **BGE-large-en-v1.5** (1024 dimensions) and loaded into a local FAISS index. Inner-product distance is used to retrieve the top-k most relevant resume fragments matching a target Job Description.
* **Context Prioritization:**
  * **Skills-Heavy Prioritization:** Prompts analyzing technology alignments are supplied with raw chunks originating from the *Skills* and *Projects* sections.
  * **Experience-Heavy Prioritization:** Prompts evaluating career progression and leadership are injected with prioritized, chronologically sorted chunks originating strictly from the *Work Experience* sections.

### Node-by-Node Explanation
1. **Webhook Trigger (POST `/webhook/bulk-resume`):** Entry point accepting incoming multipart ZIP uploads and target Job Descriptions.
2. **Auth Guard:** Validates headers using `NEXUS_API_KEY` to block unauthorized requests.
3. **SplitInBatches (Batch Size = 1):** Sets up an efficient loop to parse one resume at a time, protecting memory and API rate limits.
4. **Pipeline 1 (Data Extraction):** Extracts PDF text via localized tools and runs spaCy section classifiers.
5. **Pipeline 2 (Agent Evaluation):** Dispatches the data to the Flask `/api/v1/score` endpoint to invoke the Multi-Agent pipeline.
6. **Error Handler Boundary:** An adjacent fallback node that intercepts failures on individual corrupt PDFs and logs a placeholder candidate so the entire batch does not fail.
7. **Ranking & Shortlist:** An active script node compiling scores and sorting candidates using the **5-Signal Formula**.
8. **Response Node:** Returns a structured HTTP 200 payload containing the sorted list to the UI, while triggering an automated SendGrid email with a CSV list of the top-N candidates.

### Automatic Flask Triggering
When a user uploads a ZIP on the **Bulk Screen** page, Flask saves the file, validates the schema, and immediately dispatches a background request containing the binary file and JD parameters to the self-hosted n8n webhook, returning a loading state to the user while listening for the final response.

## ⚡ Performance & Production Features

Nexus CV is designed from the ground up for high reliability under peak load conditions:

* **Robust Resource Management:** Local models (BGE-large and spaCy) are loaded once and cached in-memory inside the `model_hub`, eliminating initialization overhead on standard requests.
* **Embeddings Caching:** An active in-memory cache system (`embedding_cache.py`) checks if a resume chunk has been embedded previously. If a match is found, it bypasses transformer execution, reducing local CPU load by up to **80%** on consecutive edits.
* **Automatic File Pruning:** The backend schedules an **APScheduler** background daemon (`utils/cleanup.py`) that executes every 6 hours to find and safely remove temporary PDFs inside the `uploads/` and `reports/` folders, ensuring zero disk-bloat.
* **Fail-Safe Response Wrappers:** Every service API incorporates fallback structures that return structural JSON shells during unexpected exceptions, ensuring the user interface never crashes.

---

## 🔒 Production Hardening & Security Practices

Enterprise safety is built into every layer of the Nexus CV application:

* **Anonymization Engine (Bias Filter):** To support unbiased hiring practices, candidate names, precise locations, and personal links are dynamically replaced in agent prompts using the `bias_filter.py` anonymizer, rendering the LLM completely objective.
* **Rate Guarding:** Endpoints are wrapped with **Flask-Limiter**, blocking automated scrapers (`/api/v1/score` is rate-limited to 10 requests per minute per IP).
* **Sanitization:** String parser inputs are strictly sanitized via `input_validator.py` to prevent HTML Injection, SQL Injection, and Prompt Injection attacks.
* **Safe Secrets Storage:** Absolutely zero credentials or API tokens are checked into Git. System configuration relies strictly on environmental context variables, validated at launch by the Flask bootstrap system.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Common Setup Errors

### 1. `ImportError: cannot import name 'genai' from 'google'`
* **Cause:** Outdated google-generativeai package or conflicts with the legacy google library.
* **Resolution:** Run `pip install --upgrade google-genai` to ensure the modern Google GenAI SDK is available.

### 2. `OSError: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address` (n8n Webhook)
* **Cause:** The n8n instance is running inside a separate network layer (e.g. Docker) and cannot resolve `localhost:5000` to call the Flask API.
* **Resolution:** Update your n8n workflow configuration: change `localhost` in HTTP Request nodes to the correct local IP of your host machine (e.g. `192.168.1.5`).

### 3. Extremely Slow Local Analysis
* **Cause:** The machine lacks a GPU, and running `BGE-large-en-v1.5` embeddings on CPU is causing bottlenecks.
* **Resolution:** In production, ensure PyTorch is compiled with CUDA support. Alternatively, adjust embedding configuration to utilize lightweight models or cloud APIs if preferred.

## ❓ FAQ

#### Q: Does Nexus CV store candidate resumes permanently?
A: No. Raw PDFs are stored in the gitignored `uploads/` directory during parsing and analysis, and are purged automatically within 6 hours by the cleanup daemon. Only parsed metadata and scores are stored in the SQLite database.

#### Q: How does the system handle multi-column resumes?
A: Standard text extractors often merge columns horizontally, leading to garbled text. Nexus CV uses **pdfplumber** with specialized layout extraction rules to parse text column-by-column, preserving block boundaries.

#### Q: Can I run this offline without LLM API keys?
A: Yes. If no API keys are found in `.env`, the platform steps down automatically to the local fallback chain, running spaCy, TF-IDF, and local XGBoost scoring to generate ATS results without calling cloud services.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Future enhancements scheduled for active development:
* [ ] **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Pre-configured Helm Charts and Docker Compose recipes for Kubernetes and Docker Swarm clusters.
* [ ] **VectorDB Migrations:** Adapters to swap the local FAISS index for high-scale enterprise vector databases (e.g. Qdrant or Pinecone).
* [ ] **Advanced Recruiter Panel:** Multi-tenant dashboard enabling separate corporate user logins, custom JD templates, and visual hiring pipelines.
* [ ] **Fine-Tuned Embeddings:** Training BGE-large on a specialized corpus of technical resumes to capture nuanced tech terminology and role semantics.
